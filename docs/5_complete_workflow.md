# Complete End-to-End Workflow Guide

## Overview
This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how the following components work together to deliver a complete solution:
- **Chunking**: Breaking down large datasets into manageable pieces.
- **Embedding**: Converting data into vector representations.
- **Qdrant**: A vector search engine for efficient retrieval.
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Utilized for processing and generating responses.

## Step-by-Step Workflow
1. **Data Ingestion**: Collect raw data.
2. **Chunking**: Split data into smaller chunks.
3. **Embedding**: Generate embeddings for each chunk.
4. **Qdrant Indexing**: Index embeddings in Qdrant for fast retrieval.
5. **Querying**: Use LLM to process queries and retrieve relevant data.

## Performance Metrics
- Processing time for chunking.
- Embedding generation speed.
- Query response time from Qdrant.
